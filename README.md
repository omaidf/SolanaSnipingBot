# WizSniper Documentation
Snipe Tokens on Solana - Pump.Fun or Raydium

More information at: https://wizsniper.com/

## Keys
Put in your license key and your private key, which you can export from any wallet. Your private key will never be sent anywhere.

## Token Name Filter
One of the best features that WizSniper has is the 'Text Filter'. Soon we'll allow multiple text filters.

**Use Case Scenario:** Solana tokens sometimes blow up based on trends. This happens probably once a day. For example, when OpenAI announced Sora, a bunch of Sora tokens were launched in the next 10 minutes.

You could add a filter for 'Sora' or 'AI'

**Example:** 'hat' - would buy any new tokens with 'hat' in it - dogwifhat tophat, etc.

This filter is case insensitive.

## Pump.Fun Tokens
If you plan on sniping Pump.Fun tokens, you need to check 'Use PumpFun Network'

You will need SOL in your wallet.

**Recommended settings:**
- Amount to buy: 1 SOL or less
- Priority Fee: .1 SOL
- Slippage: .25

On average it should take less than 10 seconds to detect a new token that's been deployed on Pump.Fun and sending a transaction that hits the Solana Network

## Raydium Tokens
If you plan on sniping Raydium Tokens you need to check 'Use Raydium Network'. To buy off Raydium you'll need to have WSOL in your wallet, you can get this off of jup.ag

This is wrapped Solana

On average it should take less than 5 seconds to detect a new token that's been deployed on Raydium and sending a transaction that hits the Solana Network

## Snipe List
If you have an early contract address for a launch coming, or know that a Pump.Fun token is migrating to Raydium, put this address here and check 'Use Snipe List'

Once you're ready, hit 'Start' you should see new tokens show up under the logs.
